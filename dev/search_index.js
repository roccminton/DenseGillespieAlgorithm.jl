Its applications are particularly prevalent in contexts such as biochemical reactions and population dynamics. The Gillespie Algorithm is employed to simulate the behaviour of systems wherein reactions or events occur at random intervals. The algorithm generates a sequence of events and their timings by first calculating the rates at which different events or reactions occur. Subsequently, the time until the next event is determined based on these rates, and the type of event that occurs next is selected according to its probability. In the final step, the system state is updated based on the event, and the process is repeated.","category":"page"},{"location":"DGAPackage.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"[Gillespie76]: D.T.
